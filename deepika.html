<b><u>Early Life</u> : </b><br>
Deepika was born in Copenhagen, Denmark and the Padukone family moved to Bangalore shortly after. Her father Prakash, is a Padma Shri award winning, champion badminton player. Like her father, Deepika has played badminton at the national level and was a state level basketball player too. Her younger sister Anisha, is a professional golfer. After completing school, she enrolled in the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a degree in sociology but soon opted out of of her academic and sports career to pursue modeling (2004). Under the guidance of fashion guru and choreographer Prasad Bidapa, Deepika modeled for a number of brands and products, the most notable of them being her work in the advertisement for Liril. She then went on to win the Model Of The Year at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards (2005) and was featured in the Kingfisher calendar later that year. Deepika made her debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Verma. The Indian film industry was curious about Deepika and Himesh Reshammiya's Naam Hai Tera gave her the recognition she deserved and paved the way for multiple film offers. She joined Anupam Kher's film academy to enhance her acting skills and her first film was the 2006 Kannada film Aishwarya. She exploded onto the big screen in 2007 with the high octane multi starrer Om Shanti Om, which proved to be a huge hit and emerged as the highest grosser of that year . Her performance opposite Shah Rukh Khan won her almost all the female debut awards that year.

<br><br>
<b><u> Career Highlights </u>: </b><br>
Following Om Shanti Om, she appeared in Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) for which she received rave reviews. Deepika had a total of 9 releases in the next three years, of these only Love Aaj Kal (2009) and Break Ke Baad (2010) were successful in reaching out and impressing the audiences. Deepika then starred in the 2012 romantic drama-comedy Cocktail; this film marked a significant turning point in her career. The year 2013 saw 4 back - to - back superhit releases Race 2, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela. She was now considered an A-lister at the top of her league. Deepika was the face of multiple brands and graced the covers of Vogue, GQ and several other publications.
