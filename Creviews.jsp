                <th align="left" ><h2>THE GHAZI ATTACK</h2><br><br><br><br>On the whole, Ghazi is one of the most unique films that has come out in Tollywood to date. Very rarely do you get to see a film which has the right story, performances, and gripping narration which hold your attention completely. Superb performance from the lead cast and thrilling underwater war drama make this film stand apart from the others. On the flip side, Ghazi is a class film which will be a bit hard to make its way in the regular mass audience who look for sheer entertainment. Barring that small glitch of its reach, Ghazi is a must watch film which every Telugu movie lover who can be extremely proud off as stuff like this comes very rarely.

                <th align="left" ><h2>JOHN WICK 2</h2><br><br>The John Wick franchise is what would happen if Woody Allen wrote action-thrillers. Just like Allen’s slice-of-life movies with high-strung characters in familiar setting, these movies are self-aware, unapologetic and true to their genre. Only here, bullet-speed dialogue is replaced by bullet-speed… well, bullets.

Sticking to the USP of the first John Wick film - a one-line plot facilitating a hundred different ways to kill - director Chad Stahelski serves up the second chapter in the protagonist’s life. Wick (Keanu Reeves), who had come out of retirement to avenge the death of his dog and the theft of his car, is approached by Santino D’Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) whom he owes a favour. Wick is coaxed into doing one last job, but eventually realizes that he’ll be the one staring down the barrel of a gun.<br><br><b> <u> Initial release</u></b>:         February 17, 2017<br>

                <th align="left" ><h2>JOLLY LLB 2</h2><br><br>On the face of it, apna Jolly is a novice indulging in petty crimes because he knows the loopholes in the law. At home, he is the hen-pecked husband of lush, Pushpa Panday(Huma) who loves whisky, Gucci dresses and her chubby son in that order. But these are just asides and not the main premise of courtroom drama, which in many ways follows the template of the 2013 prequel, Jolly LLB. 
                Writer-director Subhash Kapoor who has studied India’s burgeoning legal system of `I-will-see-you-in-court’, definitely knows as much about the Indian Penal Code as most legal sharks because of his deep study of the subject. While the last instalment dealt with a hit-n-run case, this one deals with the case of mistaken identity of a J & K terrorist. The plot has enough laugh-out-loud situations and emotional outbursts to keep you invested especially in the razor-sharp first half. The film also provides the right dose of action inside and outside the courtroom. With cops playing villains and terrorists changing religions, legal greenhorn Jolly finds himself dodging bullets in Kanpur, Lucknow and Manali(doubling up for Kashmir.)<br><br><b> <u> Initial release</u></b>:         February 10, 2017<br>

                <th align="left" ><h2>LION</h2><br><br> Verdict: A heartwarming tale of a man’s journey to his past. 

La La Land and Moonlight may be favorites to win the Oscar for the Best Picture, but Garth Davis’ Lion, which is also nominated in the same category, stands an outside chance. It may not be as stunning as the Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone starrer, but in the end, the movie will get you teary-eyed. Lion starts off with Saroo (Sunny Pawar) getting lost at a railway station after his brother leaves him there for a while. Struggling to find his way back home, the kid almost gets abducted and sold. Luckily, he is rescued and is adopted by an Australian family living in Hobart, Tasmania. Sue (Nicole Kidman) and her husband, John (David Wenham) also adopt another Indian kid after Saroo. 

After moving to Melbourne to pursue Hotel Management, Saroo (Dev Patel) falls in love with Lucy (Rooney Mara). In spite of everything going right for him, Saroo cannot ignore the flashes of his past that hound him. He keeps thinking about his life in India and decides to trace his roots. The rest of Lion shows how Saroo tries to track down his biological mother with the help of Google Earth.<br><br><b> <u> Initial release</u></b>:         February 24, 2017<br>

                <th align="left" ><h2>RANGOON</h2><br><br> Vishal Bhardwaj's film while meet a lot of critical acclaim more often than not aren't what one would call a "blockbuster". However, that doesn't mean there is no hype around his movies. Rangoon, which is his latest film, is in the news almost every day. The director pulled off a casting coup by getting Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, and Saif Ali Khan to play the lead roles. Knowing the history between Shahid Kapoor and Saif’s wife Kareena Kapoor Khan, it was surprising that the two actors agreed to work with each other. And now, they have even been spotted together for the film’s promotions. Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan are guests in the next episode of Koffee with Karan, and Shahid will join them for a particular segment. Kapoor and Ranaut also shot for The Kapil Sharma Show, but Saif Ali Khan gave it a miss. 

While Rangoon is all set to hit theatres on February 24, 2017, it was completed a long ago. In fact, its initial release date was September 2016 but the makers pushed it since Shahid Kapoor’s Udta Punjab was released in June and the actor didn't want another film of his released in quick succession. This is Kapoor’s third collaboration with Vishal Bharadwaj. They have previously worked in Haider and Kaminey, and Shahid won awards for both films. Vishal was lucky for Saif too as the actor received a lot of praise for his portrayal of Langda Tyagi in Omkara. <br><br><b> <u> Initial release</u></b>:         February 24, 2017<br>
