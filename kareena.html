<th align="left"><b><u>Born</u> : </b>September 21, 1980<br><br>
<b><u>Early Life</u> : </b><br>
Kareena is a part of the fourth generation of the legendary Kapoor family that has ruled the Indian film industry for the past five decades. She is the daughter of Randhir Kapoor and Babita and the sister of Karisma Kapoor. Kareena attended Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai, followed by Welham Girls' School in Dehradun and then pursued a degree in commerce from Mithibai College. She also completed a 3 month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard University. Kareena was exposed to the film industry at a very young age and always knew this is where she wanted to make her mark as well. She made her debut in J. P. Datta's Refugee (2000), where she was paired with Abhishek Bachchan. Her performance in the movie won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.

<br><br>
<b><u> Career Highlights </u>: </b><br>
Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) gave her instant recognition as an actress but other films, Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai, Yaadein, Ajnabee and Asoka, released in the same year were not as successful. Kareena's career suffered some major setbacks in the next two years, Khushi, Main Prem Ki Diwaani Hoon, LOC Kargil and Mujshe Dosti Karoge were unsuccessful at the box office. Her performances in films like Chameli, Yuva, Dev and Aitraaz during 2004 - 2005 were appreciated by her fans and critics alike. In 2006, Kareena starred in Omkara, 36 China Town, Chup Chup Ke, Omkara and did a cameo role in Don: The Chase Begins Again. Her free spirited performance in Jab We Met (2007) proved to be a game changer. She was in the news for her drastic makeover for the movie Tashan in 2008, but the movie proved to be quite unsuccessful. In 2009, we saw Kareena in Kambakkht Ishq and Main Aurr Mrs Khanna, both films were box office duds. Later that year Kareena starred in Kurbaan and 3 Idiots and was once again among the most sought after actresses in Bollywood. She has been a part of Rohit Shetty's Golmaal series, which has proven to be a huge feather in her cap. In 2011, Kareena was cast opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Ra. One and later opposite Salman Khan in Bodyguard, both these films were massive hits. Her noteworthy performances in 2012 include Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, Agent Vinod, Talaash and Madhur Bhandarkar's highly controversial film, Heroine. Kareena was last seen in Singham Returns (2014).
